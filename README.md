# Client_ID_generator

Client ID
The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it’s public, it’s best that it isn’t guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like a 32-character hex string. If the client ID is guessable, it makes it slightly easier to craft phishing attacks against arbitrary applications. It must also be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles.
